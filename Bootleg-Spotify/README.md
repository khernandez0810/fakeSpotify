## Description

Our motivation for this project was to create an website that pulls from 2 API's to use user data. We wanted the website to mimic something to Spotify. Hence the name Bootleg Spotify. This solves two criteria that we wanted to meet. The first is to be able to reference albums from genius based off the user's artist. The second was to provide a spotify playlist from Spotify based off the user's artist. This can help the user to find additional songs based off the playlist provided will have songs related to the artists genre. Also find all the albums if they wish to explore the artist furtther. In the end we learned to code together as a group. Flow through our ideas together to create html, css and javascript to create the project. This included pulling the API's , formatting changes to the presentation when searches are made. In the end we divided all the work evenly.
